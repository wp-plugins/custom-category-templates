Just like the way you can create custom page templates, this plugin enables you to build category archive templates by adding this bit to the top of your file:

'/**
 * Category Template: Sample
 */'
and when you're adding or editing categories, you can choose the desired template file.

You can safely include this plugin in your theme and ship custom templates for categories with the theme.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy!
